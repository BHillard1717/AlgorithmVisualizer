# AlgorithmVisualizer
Files for creating an algorithm visualizer using p5.js 

This project was done to show how certain algorithms appear after an iteration of sorting a randomized array.
This is not intended to show speed differences but to illustrate the different methods of sorting.

Feel free to use any code found here for any of your projects.
